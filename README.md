# Kneed-Walker Simulation

## What is it?
This is a MATLAB implementation of a human-like walking robot simulation. This simulation includes the hybrid dynamics of the robot,
a class for a controller and a class for the environment. Furthermore, there are recipes that can be used to calculate control signals
for the motors using genetic algorithms.
